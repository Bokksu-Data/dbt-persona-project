# Persona Project - Bokksu
### Overview
Our project focused on developing a customer segmentation strategy based on user behavior. Working with a diverse dataset, we cleaned, modeled, and analyzed the data to establish a reliable baseline. Collaborating with the Brand and Marketing teams, we gained insights into their priorities and identified key data points that drive business decisions. To wrap up the project, we created impactful data visualizations to highlight the most significant user segments and insights.

### Importance
